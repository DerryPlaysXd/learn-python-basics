"""
Welcome to the first course of the Learn-Python-Basics project!

Here you will learn how to create a new variable, print the variable out and do some basic math!
"""

# First of all let's create a variable:
aVar = 3

# We can print aVar out with the following line:
print(aVar)

# We can also do some calculations using variables
aVar = 3
# We need to define a second variable
bVar = 2
resultVar = aVar + bVar
# Once again we can print the result out 3+2 = 5, so the output will be 5
print(resultVar)

This is the end of the course! Move on to another one!
