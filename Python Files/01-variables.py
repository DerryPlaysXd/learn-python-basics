"""
Welcome to the first course of the Learn-Python-Basics project!

Here you will learn how to create a new variable, print the variable out and do some basic math!
"""

#First of all let's create a variable:
aVar = 3

#We can print aVar out with the following line:
print(aVar)

#We can also do a simple user input into another variable, the user will be prompted to input a number
aVar = int(input("Input a number:   "))
#Once again we can print the variable out:
print(aVar)

This is the end of the course! Move on to another one!
